Embellishment EMBOSS / DEBOSS
This process creates raised (embossed) or sunken (debossed)  
designs on the fabric surface. Both of these decorative effects  work well with leather garments. 
EMBROIDERY
Embroidery uses a special machine that is programmed to stitch  a design that combines texture, pattern and color. 
3D PUFF EMBROIDERY
Is a technique where foam is inserted under the top stitch to raise the surface, giving a three-dimensional look to your embroidery designs. The 3D foam effect is commonly used on garments that don’t require much washing.
WOVEN PATCH
Woven patches have a higher deﬁnition of the graphic and lettering than an embroidered patch. They are more accurate and have precise detail, smaller lettering, are ﬂatter and easier to sew or  iron with and are able to have. Woven patches can be made in  a much smaller size without losing integrity, even down to  half of an inch. (large orders only)
CRESTS / PATCHES
Crests are embroidered on drill twill and die cut to shape. The edges are narrowed for a clean ﬁnish. Crests are then sewn onto the garment to complete the look.
HEAT TRANSFER
A digital printing process which utilizes high temperature to transfer and adhere your design to the fabric surface. This process uses many of the same inks and techniques that are used in printing.  A cost-effective decoration technique. Perfect for  waterproof fabrics.

Complete  
The Look 
You Desire53TACKLE TWILL
Tackle twill is a form of applique created using polyester twill 
material which is layered and applied to the garments with a border stitch. It is widely utilized when crafting sportswear as well as logo memorabilia for sports fans. Tackle twill keeps the number of stitches as low as possible. It is also a lot ﬁrmer than regular embroidery and it feels smooth and pleasant to the touch.
REFLECTIVE HEAT SEAL
Engineered to reﬂect light, our reﬂective transfers are designed to increase visibility for workers, joggers, children or anyone who spends time outside.
LASER ETCHING
Uses laser technology to engrave or burn a mark into the fabric. This technique is perfect for microﬂeece, denim, softshell and performance polyester fabrics. Laser etching on ﬂeece items burns the top layer of the fabric resulting in a darker, tonal mark on the garment. The tone of the mark will vary based on the color of the fabric. Medium colored fabrics achieve a more distinguishable design than on darker or lighter fabrics. On denim garments,  the process removes the pigment as it burns the fabric.
APPLIQUE
Annplique refers to a needlework technique in which patterns or representational scenes are created by the attachment of smaller pieces of fabric to a larger piece of contrasting color or texture.CHENILLE
Chenille is a type of embroidery made with loops of yarn,  a textured surface that resembles carpet, resulting in a ﬁnished  
design with a soft, fuzzy appearance. It offers a sophisticated  
collegiate or high-end corporate look with tactile richness  
that only chenille can offer. (by special order only)
PVC PATCH
PVC patches are a modern alternative to the more common embroidered patch. Made of a durable plastic, PVC comes in an endless array of colours that can bring your custom design to life with a look and feel that is unachievable with embroidery. PVC patches are waterproof and will never fade, fray,  crack or peel.(by special order only)54
